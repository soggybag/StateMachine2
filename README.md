# StateMachine

This is a simple example illustrating how you might work with GKStateMachine and GKState. These classes are part of 
GameplayKit. 

Use a statemachine to organize your code into logical subsystems. A state machine might be a good choice if you 
find your project is mired in a tangled web of state variables and conditional statements. 

The state machine manages a list of states and only one state is active at any time.
